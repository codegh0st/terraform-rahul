# terraform-rahul

WARNING: IN THIS REPO I HAVE COMMENTED HERE AND THERE, CODE LOOKS NASTY, BUT ITS OK FOR ME, MY MAIN GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT FIRST,
SO I TRYED TO SIMPLIFIED DESCRIBE THE IN CODE ITSELF, SO WHN I SEE AFTER SOMETIME CODE AND COMMENT BOTH WILL BE IN SAME PAGE. 
THANK YOU. 

This is personal note and terraform code, i have written and explained in my own words 
in such a way that whenever i needed,
i can recall the it easily. and implement whatever it is required. 
#Thank-you i will update this repository later.
